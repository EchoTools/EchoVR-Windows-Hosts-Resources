## Setting up a new server? 
> [!TIP]
> Install echo on your server machine with [Mia's installer](https://github.com/marshmallow-mia/Echo-VR-Installer/releases) before starting.

Download EchoVR-Server-Setup.py from the code area, compile it, and run it for a streamlined setup experience. Executable binary coming soon(tm)
<br>Otherwise, just follow the [setup guide](https://github.com/EchoTools/EchoVR-Windows-Hosts-Resources/wiki/Setup-Guide) to get the same result.

## Just need the server monitor?
Download EchoVR-Server-Monitor.ps1 from the releases tab.
<br>Give the [usage guide](https://github.com/EchoTools/EchoVR-Windows-Hosts-Resources/wiki/Usage-Guide) a quick skim before starting.
